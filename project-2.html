			<div class="part"><div class="desc">Summary:</div><p>A web-based mobile application designed to increase productivity by removing potential distractions and avoiding burn-out, with inspiration drawn from other games (such as Habitica, Neko Atsume, etc).</p></div>

			<div class="part" style="clear:both;"><div class="desc">Creation:</div><p>Our task was to design and implement a 'game' to help with an everyday need -- in our case, we chose to tackle the ever-present issue of productivity. Drawing inspiration from Pomodoro timers and other games, we created TimeyQuest: The Productivity RPG.</p></div>	
			<img src="tq-01.png" style="float: right; margin: 25px 30px 0px 10px; width: 300px;"/>

			<div class="part"><div class="desc">Challenges:</div><p>As an extended project, time management was key. Each group member had specific tasks to accomplish, based on prior experience. However, we all had to learn new skills to accomplish our tasks; in my case, implementing everything <img src="tq-04.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px; width: 200px"/>(other than images) on the front-end required learning JavaScript, jQuery, and a little bit of Firebase (our database system).
			<br><br>
			Not only that, but our endeavors to find ways to engage the user/player with intuitive gameplay and interfaces served as a markedly new experience for the entire group -- as computer science students, having to handle the 'user experience' portion of our app was difficult at first.</div></p>

			<div class="part"><div class="desc">Results:</div><p>In the end, not only was the new knowledge of JS/jQuery invaluable, the method of producing our application -- through heuristic evaluations, user testing, user feedback, A/B testing, etc. -- gave us all a greater understanding of user-centered design and of the design process itself.</p></div>
